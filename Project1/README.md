# Project 1: Search
## Introduction
In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.  

As in Project 0, this project includes an autograder for you to grade your answers on your machine. This can be run with the command:  

`python autograder.py`  
See the autograder tutorial in Project 0 for more information about using the autograder.  

The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the assignment, and some of which you can ignore. You can download all the code and supporting files as a [zip archive](http://ai.berkeley.edu/projects/release/search/v1/001/search.zip).  

##### Files you'll edit:
[search.py](http://ai.berkeley.edu/projects/release/search/v1/001/docs/search.html)	Where all of your search algorithms will reside.
[searchAgents.py](http://ai.berkeley.edu/projects/release/search/v1/001/docs/searchAgents.html)	Where all of your search-based agents will reside.
